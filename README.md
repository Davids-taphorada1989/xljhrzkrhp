Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare, and let me tell you, my brain feels like a knotted ball of yarn a cat had way too much fun with. Seriously, where do I even start? Probably with the fact that Neverland got a facelift by a horror designer who's been binging on gothic novels. It’s not like Disneyland with its sparkly magic, more like if Tim Burton had a bad day and decided to show us his dark side.

Peter Pan was... well, he’s definitely not the cheeky kid I vaguely remember. He's more like someone who didn’t get the memo about horror  s not really needing flying boys. Capturing him is like trying to nail jello to a tree. There I was, sitting in the theater, thinking, What did Tinkerbell drink to land herself in this mess? Her glow definitely wasn't fairy dust—it’s more like she got tangled up in a grimy glow-stick rave gone wrong. 

> Here’s a shocker: somehow, Captain Hook became the least terrifying. I won't say charming, because that'd be a lie and weird, but let's just say if I had to pick someone to be chased by, Hook would be my guy. Maybe it’s because he still has that Disney villain flair that kind of felt like a warm... glove? No, that's stupid. Anyway, you get it.

The Lost Boys, though—didn't see that coming. Yard squirrels in tiny leather jackets, probably. They looked like they'd mug you for an avocado toast. And as much as I tried, I couldn't shake the feeling that the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘳𝘴 must have been jamming to the Bee Gees singing on a broken record player, all dissonance and eerie giggles.

On a curious note, a lot of adults in the theater were on edge. We’re all complicit now. A grown-up society, clutching our popcorn tubs like they're life vests. And I swear every time someone asked “Why is it like this?” I couldn't help thinking: life, my dear friend, precisely life. Like it or not, we’ve all signed up for this boat cruise with Peter, and by God, do we sail rough waters.

```cpp
#include <io𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮>
void escapeNeverland(bool fear = true) {
    if (fear) std::cout << Run! << std::endl;
}
```

The point is, I'm sitting here trying to wrap my head around it, and maybe I won't succeed today. Maybe it’s unexpectedly brilliant or stupid, or probably somewhere in between. But go on, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you dare—𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and try to figure out which. Just don’t blame me when you walk out convinced your shadow might just shiv you in an alley.
